# Notes before starting
Planning the WAN & LAN port groups

The above is not the best practice, because for OPNsense to download stuff (such as IPS rules), the WAN needs to be connected to the internet. AND our physical NIC can only be used to allocate to one vSwitch to provide internet connectivity.
It looks like this when disconnected from internet (unable to check for updates & resolution error)

So, we need to connect WAN and LAN port groups to the same vSwitch and give them different port groups.

Alternatively, same port group, same vswitch, but different VLAN ID for WAN.

# Installation
Download dvd
Extract ISO file
upload iso to ESXi

Create a New vSwitch and new Port group for WAN

Create VM, attach iso, make sure disk is large enough (minimum >20gb for thin provisioned), attach NIC (WAN port group), and give mac addresses:

**Important:** When booted, it automatically runs in live CD mode.
After the configuration, we need to login as installer (password: opnsense), and then the actual installation will start.

Otherwise, in the web UI, it will prompt "you are currently in live CD mode, config will not be saved"
